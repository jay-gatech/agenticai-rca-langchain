Thought: I need to gather telemetry from payment-service to understand the anomaly.
Following OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Jaeger architecture .

Action: collect_telemetry
Action Input: {"service_name": "payment-service", 
               "time_window": "2025-10-17T00:50:00Z/2025-10-17T01:10:00Z"}

Observation: Retrieved from Prometheus : CPU=45%, Memory=78%, Latency P99=5.2s 
(baseline: 0.2s, 26× increase). Elasticsearch logs show: "WARN HikariPool-1: 
Connection pool exhausted, waited 30000ms". Jaeger traces  indicate: 
payment-service → database-service calls taking 4.8s average. Circuit breaker 
pattern could reduce error rate by 58% .

Thought: Anomaly detected: database connection pool exhaustion causing increased 
latency. Need to analyze causal relationships using RCD algorithm  which 
treats failures as interventions .

Action: infer_causality
Action Input: {"anomalies": ["db_connection_pool_exhausted", "high_db_query_latency"],
               "service_graph": dependency_graph}

Observation: Applied hierarchical RCD algorithm  which pinpoints root causes 
without learning full graph . Causal graph shows payment-service deployment at 
00:55:00Z introduced N+1 query pattern. Each transaction now executes 10 sequential 
DB queries instead of 1 batched query. Under load (500 req/s), this exhausts 
connection pool (50 max). PageRank score : 0.92 confidence payment-service 
is root cause. Neural Granger causality  confirms temporal precedence.

Thought: Root cause identified using causal inference . Recent deployment 
introduced inefficient query pattern. Should recommend rollback following Kubernetes 
best practices  or horizontal scaling .

Action: execute_remediation
Action Input: {"action": "rollback_deployment", 
               "params": {"service": "payment-service", "target_version": "v2.4.1"}}

Observation: Rollback initiated via Kubernetes API . Deployment rolled back 
from v2.5.0 to v2.4.1. Monitoring Prometheus metrics  for 2 minutes... Latency 
recovered to 0.3s average (98.5% improvement). Connection pool utilization dropped 
to 12/50. Auto-scaling mechanisms  adjusted replicas from 10 to 6 based on 
reduced CPU usage. Circuit breaker pattern effectiveness validated .

Final Answer:
**Root Cause (using causal inference )**: Deployment v2.5.0 of payment-service 
at 00:55:00Z introduced N+1 database query pattern, exhausting connection pool under load.

**Evidence from observability stack **:
- Prometheus metrics : Latency P99 spiked 26× (0.2s → 5.2s)
- Elasticsearch logs: Connection pool exhaustion warnings (50/50 connections used)
- Jaeger traces : Sequential DB calls (10 per transaction vs 1 baseline)
- Causal graph (RCD algorithm ): PageRank score 0.92 confidence
- Neural Granger causality : Temporal precedence confirmed

**Remediation**: Rolled back to v2.4.1 via Kubernetes API . System recovered in 
2 minutes. Auto-scaling  reduced replicas from 10 to 6 based on actual CPU 
usage, optimizing resource utilization .

**Prevention**: Add database query performance test to CI/CD pipeline detecting 
inefficient patterns before production deployment. Implement circuit breaker pattern 
which can reduce error rates by 58% . Configure HPA  with appropriate CPU/memory 
thresholds following best practices .
